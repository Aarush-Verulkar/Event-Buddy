                                                EventBuddy is a website that helps users select any venue of their choice and publish their own events. The venue could be selected for any kind of activities like birthdays, weddings, playgrounds, turfs and many more. The website saves the user the hassle of personally going to the event location to check the availability of the venue and can book the venue at a moment’s notice via their phones or electronic devices. The website provides one-to-one connection with the event manager and fair rates with all the necessary precautions taken.It is about building a portfolio/resume for our team, because we want to make a future for ourselves in this competent industry, one requires herculean level of knowledge and skill to get into this industry, so the best way to gain both skill and knowledge is to start making such websites and we are still a college students and have 2 more years to graduate from our course so side by side we have planned to develop this website that would ensure that we will gain practical and real life work experience as well as deep theoretical knowledge from my college course
